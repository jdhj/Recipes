Ingredients:
 - 2.5cm (1-inch) piece of fresh ginger
 - 6 cloves of garlic
 - 1 teaspoon chilli powder
 - 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
 - 1 kg (2lb) lamb neck fillet, cut in large pieces
 - oil for deep frying
 - 4 large onions, sliced very finely
 - 625g (1 1/4lb) basmati rice, picked, washed and soaked for 30 minutes
 - 900ml (1 1/2 pints) water
 - 250ml (9 fl oz) natural yoghurt, beaten
 - 250ml (9 fl oz) milk
 - a handful each of coriander and mint leaves, chopped
 - 4 green chillies, de-seeded if wished and chopped
 - 1/2 teaspoon cardamom seeds, crushed
 - juice of 1 lemon
 - a few strands of saffron, soaked in 4 tablespoons hot milk or water
 - 125ml (4 fl oz) hot water
 - a little concentrated butter or ghee
 - salt to taste

Directions:
 1. Blend the ginger, garlic, chilli powder, ground turmeric and salt to taste
     to a paste.
 2. Rub the paste well into the meat pieces and keep aside.
 3. In a wok or a large pan, heat the oil and fry the onions till they are deep
     brown and crisp.
 4. Remove with a slotted spoon on to absorbent paper and allow to cool,
     reserving the oil.
 5. Reserving a handful for garnish, crush the onions and add them to the lamb 
     pieces and mix well.
 6. In a separate pan put the rice in the water with some salt and bring it to
     the boil once; then drain off the water and set it aside.
 7. Take a large heavy saucepan which has a tight-fitting lid and add four
     tablespoons of the oil in which you have fried the onions.
 8. Evenly cover the base and put a layer of meat at the bottom.
 9. Mix the yoghurt, milk, half the coriander and mint leaves, all the chillies,
     cardamom seeds and lemon juice together.
10. Sprinkle half of this mixture over the meat.
11. Then spread half the rice over the meat.
12. Sprinkle the rest of the coriander and mint leaves over the rice.
13. Layer all the remaining meat over the rice and pour in the second half of
     the yoghurt mixture.
14. Make the last layer with the rest of the rice.
15. Make deep holes with the handle of a wooden spoon or a chopstick and into 
     each hole pour a little of the dissolved saffron.
16. Sprinkle the water over the top layer of rice and add a few small pieces of
     concentrated butter or ghee.
17. Cover the pan with a cloth or a sheet of foil and then the lid.
18. Weight the lid down if possible (I use another pan filled with water).
19. Place the pan on the lowest heat (use a heat diffuser if your heat cannot
     be easily controlled) and allow the biryani to cook until the meat and rice
     are done.
20. Check after 25-30 minutes by pinching a few grains of rice or pushing a knife
     through: it should come out clean. If it is not cooked and all the water
     has been absorbed, sprinkle on a little more hot water and leave to cook,
     tightly re-covered. While checking, work fast as you should not allow too
     much steam to escape.
21. Before serving, gently mix the rice and meat and garnish with the reserved
     browned onions.
